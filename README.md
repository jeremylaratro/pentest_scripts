# pentest_scripts
> This repository contains simple discovery/enumeration scripts with the focus of thorough enumeration for my OSCP course. The start script aims to streamline initial enumeration, using nmap for top port checks with version check, rustscan for thorough port analysis, as well as options for web enumeration using gobuster, smb analysis using enum4linux, RPC analysis with rpcclient, among others.  
I also added an accessory script which performs thorough vulnerability/exploit checking, which consists of extracting service names and versions and then using searchsploit and nmap scripts to check for vulnerabilities.

Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/jeremylaratro/pentest_scripts.git
```
```
cd pentest_scripts && chmod +x start.sh
```
```
./start.sh -i <ip_addr> -a
```
